# **Argon Molecular Dynamics**

**That is a simple molecular dynamics simulation for one type of atom (especially Argon) interacting with van der Waals' forces. One may observe the solid &rarr; gas phase transition and investigate thermodynamical properties that characterise the gas state.**

# **What is Molecular Dynamics?**
**Referring to Wikipedia:**

_**"Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation method for analyzing the physical movements of atoms and molecules. The atoms and molecules are allowed to interact for a fixed period of time, giving a view of the dynamic "evolution" of the system. In the most common version, the trajectories of atoms and molecules are determined by numerically solving Newton's equations of motion for a system of interacting particles, where forces between the particles and their potential energies are often calculated using interatomic potentials or molecular mechanics force fields."**_

```c++
Argon *A = new Argon;
```

For visualisation, we may use an open-source viewer [Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/).
