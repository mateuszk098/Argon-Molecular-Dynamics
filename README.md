# **Argon Molecular Dynamics**
**That is simple simulation of molecular dynamics for one type of atoms interacting van der Waals' forces. One may to observe the solid -> gas phase transition and investigate thermodynamical properties characterises gas state. For the purpose of visualization we may use an open-source [Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/).**
